          <h3>Nature</h3>
          <p>I have always been drawn to the outdoors since I was young. 
              It is filled with a vast amount of unknowns that will always keep me interested
            My fascination with nature has mainly focused to the aquatic side of things and the fact that we have only discovered 20% of the worlds oceans still blows my mind.
        We have discovered a far greater percentage of our moon and the planet Mars than we have mapped and studied our own oceans.</p>
        <p>So whenever I get the chance to travel on vacation, the first thing I look for are bodies of water and remote locations to seek refuge in the middle of nowhere.

          <h3>Fish Keeping/Aquascaping</h3>
          <p>My father has surrounded me with fish keeping ever since I can remember. I was 16 when I first started keeping live bearing fish and getting really into the hobby. 
            It hasn't been until recently that I have the more artistic side to fish keeping called Aquascaping. It has captured 100% of my attention and about the same amount of my wallet.
          </p>
<p>
    Aquascaping focuses more on the artistic and naturalistic representation of fishkeeping. Some realms of aquascaping can almost replic the environments of the freshwater fish,
while others go for different artistic styles like minimalism. (See Figure 1)

          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>Despite my love for all things revolving aaround nature I am still extremely intersted and invovled with technology.
              My father can be thanked for introducing me to such an interesting topic that is ever so evolving and will most liekly never stop evolving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beginnings of my introduction to technology started probably where most people my age started, videogames.
            It all started with Nintendo's Nintendo 64, then once my family got an original Xbox the interest in technology sprouted from there.
            Now that I am older and have been working a stable job for a while I will be looking into building a strong gaming oriented computer and branch away from consoles for videogames.
